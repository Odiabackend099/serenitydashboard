name: Serenity Dashboard Rules
rules:
  - Use strict TypeScript in both web and api.
  - Prefer zod for input validation.
  - Keep PRs small and focused.
  - Write tests first for new modules when feasible.
  - Enforce RBAC in server routes and guard client navigation.
  - Use consistent file naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components.
  - Avoid inline secrets; use env vars.
